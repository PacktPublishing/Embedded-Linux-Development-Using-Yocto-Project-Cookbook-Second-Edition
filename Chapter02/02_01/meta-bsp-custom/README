I. Adding the bsp-custom layer to your build
=================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the bsp-custom layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the bsp-custom layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

BBLAYERS = " \
  ${BSPDIR}/sources/poky/meta \
  ${BSPDIR}/sources/poky/meta-poky \
  ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-openembedded/meta-oe \
  ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-openembedded/meta-multimedia \
  ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-freescale \
  ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-freescale-3rdparty \
  ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-freescale-distro \
  ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-bsp-custom \
"

II. Misc
========

This layer should be used in conjuntion with the "Embedded Linux Projects
Using Yocto Project Cookbook" 2nd edition  published by Packt Publising.
