# Embedded Linux Development using Yocto Projects - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Embedded Linux Development using Yocto Projects - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/embedded-linux-development-using-yocto-projects-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788470469), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Yocto Project is turning out to be the best integration framework for creating reliable embedded Linux projects. It has the edge over other frameworks because of its features such as less development time and improved reliability and robustness.

Embedded Linux Development using Yocto Project starts with an in-depth explanation of all Yocto Project tools, to help you perform different Linux-based tasks. The book then moves on to in-depth explanations of Poky and BitBake. It also includes some practical use cases for building a Linux subsystem project using Yocto Project tools available for embedded Linux. The book also covers topics such as SDK, recipetool, and others.

By the end of the book, you will have learned how to generate and run an image for real hardware boards and will have gained hands-on experience at building efficient Linux systems using Yocto Project.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
#include "imx6q-wandboard-revd1.dts"
#include "imx6qp.dtsi"
/ {
 model = "Wandboard i.MX6QuadPlus rev.D1";
};
```

This books assumes some basic working knowledge of GNU/Linux systems and
applications such as the bash shell and derivatives, as well as standard tools such as grep,
patch, and diff. The examples have been tested with an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS system, but any
Linux distribution supported by the Yocto project can be used.
The book is structured to follow the usual development workflow of an embedded Linux
product, but chapters, or even individual recipes, can be read independently.
Recipes take a practical, hands-on approach using an NXP i.MX6-based system, the
Wandboard Quad, as base hardware. However, any other i.MX-based hardware can be
used to follow the examples.
