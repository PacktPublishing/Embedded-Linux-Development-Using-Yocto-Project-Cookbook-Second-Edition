I. Adding the custom layer to your build
=================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the custom layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the custom layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

BBLAYERS = " \
	${BSPDIR}/sources/poky/meta \
	${BSPDIR}/sources/poky/meta-yocto \
	\
	${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-openembedded/meta-oe \
	${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-openembedded/meta-multimedia \
	\
	${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-freescale \
	${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-freescale-3rdparty \
	${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-custom \
"


II. Misc
========

This layer should be used in conjuntion with the "Embedded Linux Projects
Using Yocto Project Cookbook" 2nd edition  published by Packt Publising.
